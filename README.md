# gpupytests

This is just a scratchpad for messing around with communicating with a GPU from 
Python code. It's not actually a coherent program or structured comparisson of
various ways of doing things - it's more like a bunch of notes spread out over
several commits.

I don't think the code in this repo will be useful for anyone else, but putting
it in a Github repo is quite a convenient free way of backing things up in case
my house burns down.
